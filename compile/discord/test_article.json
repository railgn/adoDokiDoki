            "Photos of the venue and lobby of the Ado National Tour 2023 \"Mars\" held on September 16 and 17, 2023, at Yokohama Arena in Kanagawa, Japan, are now available. The fastest report of the entire Ado National Tour 2023 \"Mars\" will be updated at a later date. Please be forewarned.",
            "On September 16 (Sat.) and 17 (Sun.), a large number of guests gathered at Yokohama Arena for the final performance of \"Mars. The weather was fine on both days, and although it was mid-September, the temperature was over 30 degrees Celsius, making both days very hot and humid. Fortunately, all the booths were located in the lobby of the Yokohama Arena, so we were able to enjoy some relief from the heat. In addition to the performances at the Nippon Budokan and Osaka-jo Hall, the \"Kigeki,\" \"Kampanella,\" and \"Mirage\" costume and Adoart displays were also held at the Yokohama Arena, including this show. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please understand that this is a work that was actually enjoyed by the visitors. Saturday, September 16th, Yokohama Arena, in the morning, was another fine day. Except for a few performances, the tour with \"Mars\" was blessed with good weather. Also, it rained or met with torrential rain at some performances, but on some days the rain stopped before the doors opened or after the show, and we had to think that the weather was also overwhelmed by the power of the visitors who came to the show and recovered, etc. ■On both days, a very large number of visitors gathered early in the morning prior to the opening of each booth. At the Yokohama Arena, we had visitors line up in a single week around the perimeter of the site, which must have been very difficult from the morning, but there was no confusion, and they lined up in line in the guide lines for each booth. Thank you very much for your cooperation and support during the whole day. There seemed to be no big crowds or congestion in the venue even though everyone entered the venue according to the QR code issued. This may be the reason why there were many customers who were examining and purchasing goods. Especially, many customers purchased a lot of goods at one time because the show was coming to its final performance at \"Mars\". On both December 16 and 17, there was a CD sales booth next to the merchandise booth. This booth was crowded with customers who pre-ordered \"Ado no Utattemita Album\", which will be released on December 13, 2023, at Yokohama Arena. ■Gacha-gacha booth was especially popular with many people all the way from before to after the show. Many people were playing with the gachacha in large quantities, and were happy, disappointed, and full of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure as they opened the gacha cases with their friends. The \"Ado's Doki-Doki Secret Base\" booth was also very busy. The \"Uchiwa\" (fan) was very popular again this year, and many people used it every day after it was handed over to them. The Ado lottery was also a great success, with many visitors enjoying the lottery and the staff having fun together with the participants, even though they were aiming for a \"mad (bad) luck. The \"Ado Rosatormally\" booth had a long line of people waiting for the goods even before the start of the sales. The popular plush toys were sold out quickly, but the \"AdRosa Tolmaly\" walked around the venue again and again, greeting everyone. Will we see her again somewhere in the future? ■■ Also, at the Yokohama Arena concert, we displayed the \"Ado's Closet Booth\" that was reproduced at this year's Cho-Kaigi. Many people stopped by to check out the equipment and take pictures. On both days, many visitors were outside the venue before the doors opened, and after the doors opened, there was a huge crowd in the lobby. After the show, there were many people taking pictures outside the venue with penlights in their hands. The blue light was fantastic in some places, and it was a very beautiful scenery. Thank you very much for coming to the Yokohama Arena concert and all the \"Mars\" performances."
